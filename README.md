### Projects

### [Blockchain-based Intelligent Disbursement in NSP](https://github.com/LifnaJos/Blockchain-based-National-Scholarship-Portal) - (August 2023 - November 2024)

- Members: Neelkanth Khithani, [Kushl Alve](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kushl-alve/), [Vedang Gambhire](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vedang-gambhire-114049254/), Shivam Choubey, [Atharva Hande](https://www.linkedin.com/in/atharva-hande/), [Asmi Rajbhar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/asmi-rajbhar-818613239/)
- Abstract: The [National Scholarship Portal (NSP)](https://scholarships.gov.in/) faces challenges like non-automated systems, complex processes, physical verifications, fraud, delays, and data security. This project proposes a blockchain-based solution to create a tamper-proof, streamlined, and secure system, enhancing trust and accountability in scholarship management.
